### 4. Implement the Code

1. **Source Code**:
   - **Controllers**: Handle the application logic for routes.
   - **Models**: Define the data structure for trains, tickets, and users.
   - **Routes**: Define the API endpoints or application routes.
   - **Services**: Implement business logic (e.g., booking calculations, availability checks).
   - **Utils**: Add helper functions (e.g., validation).

2. **Testing**:
   - Write tests for your models, controllers, and services to ensure the system functions correctly.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update the `docs` directory with API documentation, user guides, or design documents.

### 5. Maintain the Repository

- **Regular Updates**: Keep the codebase up-to-date with new features and fixes.
- **Documentation**: Regularly update the `README.md` and other documentation to reflect changes.
- **Issue Tracking**: Use GitHub Issues to manage bugs and feature requests.
- **Code Reviews**: Encourage code reviews and collaboration through Pull Requests.

By following these steps, youâ€™ll create a well-structured, documented, and functional GitHub repository for your ticket booking system. This will make it easier for others to understand, use, and contribute to your project.
